Early life

Druitt was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England. He was the second son and third child of prominent local surgeon William Druitt, and his wife Ann (née Harvey). William Druitt was a Justice of the Peace, a governor of the local grammar school, and a regular worshiper at the local Anglican church, the Minster.[2] Montague was christened at the Minster by his maternal great-uncle, Rev. William Mayo, six weeks after his birth.[3] The Druitts lived at Westfield House, which was the largest house in the town and set in its own grounds with stables and servants' cottages.[4] The house still stands in Wimborne Minster at the end of Westfield Close and is now subdivided into flats. Montague had six brothers and sisters,[2] including an elder brother William who entered the law, and a younger brother Edward who joined the Royal Engineers.[5]

Montague was educated at Winchester College, where he won a scholarship at the age of 13, and excelled at sports, especially cricket and fives.[6] He was active in the school's debating society: an interest that may have spawned his desire to become a barrister.[7] He spoke in favour of French republicanism, compulsory military service, and the resignation of Benjamin Disraeli, and against the Ottoman Empire, the influence of Otto von Bismarck, and the conduct of the government in the Tichbourne case.[8] He defended William Wordsworth as "a bulwark of Protestantism",[9] and condemned the execution of King Charles I as "a most dastardly murder that will always attach to England's fair name as a blot".[8] In a light-hearted debate, he spoke against the proposition that bondage to fashion is a social evil.[8][9] In his final year at Winchester, 1875–76, he was Prefect of Chapel, treasurer of the debating society, school fives champion, and opening bowler for the cricket team.[9] In June 1876, he played cricket against Eton College, whose winning team included cricketing luminaries Ivo Bligh and Kynaston Studd, and future Principal Private Secretary at the Home Office Evelyn Ruggles-Brise. Druitt bowled out Studd for four.[10] With a glowing academic record, he was awarded a Winchester Scholarship to New College, Oxford.[11]
At New College, he was popular with his peers, and was elected Steward of the Junior Common Room by his fellow students.[12] He played cricket and rugby for the college team, and was the winner of both double and single fives at the university in 1877.[13] In a seniors' cricket match in 1880, he bowled out William Patterson, who later captained Kent County Cricket Club.[14] Druitt graduated from Oxford in 1880 with a third class Bachelor of Arts degree in Classics.[12] Montague's youngest brother, Arthur, entered New College in 1882,[15] just as Montague followed in his eldest brother William's footsteps by embarking on a career in the law.[16]

The Inner Temple, 1895
Sketch by Herbert Railton
On 17 May 1882, two years after graduation, Druitt was admitted to the Inner Temple, one of the qualifying bodies for English barristers. His father had promised him a legacy of £500 (equivalent to £37,000 today),[17] and Druitt paid his membership fees with a loan from his father secured against the inheritance.[18] He was called to the bar on 29 April 1885, and set up a practice as a barrister and special pleader.[19] Druitt's father died suddenly from a heart attack in September 1885, leaving an estate valued at £16,579 (equivalent to £1,327,000 today).[17][20] In a codicil, Druitt senior instructed his executors to deduct the money he had advanced to his son from the legacy of £500. Montague received very little money, if any, from his father's will, although he did receive some of his father's personal possessions.[21] Most of Dr Druitt's estate went to his wife Ann, three unmarried daughters (Georgiana, Edith and Ethel), and eldest son William.[22]
Druitt rented legal chambers at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple.[23] In the late Victorian era only the wealthy could afford legal action, and only one in eight qualified barristers was able to make a living from the law.[24] While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish,[25] others suppose that it provided him with a relatively substantial income on the basis of his costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death.[26][27] He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the Western Circuit and Winchester Sessions, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton Assizes.[28]
To supplement his income and help pay for his legal training, Druitt worked as an assistant schoolmaster at George Valentine's boarding school, 9 Eliot Place, Blackheath, London, from 1880.[29] The school had a long and distinguished history; Benjamin Disraeli had been a student there in the 1810s, and boys from the school had been playmates of a younger son of Queen Victoria, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, who as a boy in the 1860s had lived nearby at Greenwich Park.[30] Druitt's post came with accommodation in Eliot Place, and the long school holidays gave him time to study the law and to pursue his interest in cricket.[31]
[edit]Cricket

In Dorset, Druitt played for the Kingston Park Cricket Club,[32] and the Dorset County Cricket Club.[33] He was particularly noted for his skill as a bowler.[34][35] In 1882 and 1883, he toured the West Country with a gentleman's touring team called the Incogniti.[36] One of Druitt's fellow local players was Francis Lacey, the first man knighted for services to cricket.[37] Druitt played for another wandering team, the Butterflies, on 14 June 1883, when they drew against his alma mater Winchester College. The team included first-class cricketers A. J. Webbe, J. G. Crowdy, John Frederick and Charles Seymour.[38]
While working at Blackheath, Druitt joined the local cricket club, Blackheath Morden, and became the club's treasurer.[39][40] It was a well-connected club: the President was politician Sir Charles Mills and one of its players was Stanley Christopherson.[41] After the merger of the club with other local sports associations to form the Blackheath Cricket, Football and Lawn Tennis Company, Druitt took on the additional roles of company secretary and director.[39][42] The inaugural game of the new club was played against George Gibbons Hearne's Eleven, which included many members of the famous cricketing Hearne family. Hearne's team won by 21 runs.[43] On 5 June 1886, in a match between Blackheath and a gentleman's touring team called the Band of Brothers, led by Lord Harris, Druitt bowled Harris for 14 and took three other wickets. Blackheath won by 178 runs.[44] Two weeks later, he dismissed England batsman John Shuter, who was playing for Bexley Cricket Club, for a duck, and Blackheath won the game by 114 runs.[45] The following year, Shuter returned to Blackheath with a Surrey County side that included Walter Read, William Lockwood, and Bobby Abel, whom Druitt bowled out for 56. Surrey won by 147 runs.[46]
On 26 May 1884, Druitt was elected to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) on the recommendation of his fellow Butterflies player Charles Seymour, who proposed him, and noted fielder Vernon Royle, who seconded his nomination.[47] One of the minor matches he played for MCC was with England bowler William Attewell against Harrow School on 10 June 1886. MCC won by 57 runs.[48] He also played against MCC for Blackheath: on 23 July 1887, he bowled out Dick Pougher for 28 runs, but Druitt only made 5 runs before he was bowled out by Arnold Fothergill with a ball caught by Pougher. MCC won by 52 runs.[49]
In June 1888, Lord Harris played twice for Blackheath with Druitt and Stanley Christopherson; Blackheath won both matches easily, but Druitt was off form and contributed neither runs nor wickets in either match.[50] In August 1888, Druitt played for the Gentlemen of Bournemouth against the Parsees cricket team during their tour of England, and took five wickets in the visitors' first innings. Nevertheless, the Parsees won.[51] On 8 September 1888, the Blackheath Club played against the Christopherson brothers. Druitt was bowled out by Stanley Christopherson, who was playing with his brothers instead of for Blackheath, and in reply Druitt bowled out Christopherson. Blackheath won by 22 runs.[52][53]
In addition to cricket, Druitt also participated in field hockey.[54]
[edit]Death

On Friday 30 November 1888, Druitt was dismissed from his post at the Blackheath boys' school. The reason for his dismissal is unclear.[27][55] One newspaper, quoting his brother William's inquest testimony, reported that he was dismissed because he "had got into serious trouble", but did not specify any further.[56] In early December 1888, he disappeared, and on 21 December 1888 the Blackheath Cricket Club's minute book records that he was removed as treasurer and secretary in the belief that he had "gone abroad".[57]
On 31 December 1888, his body was found floating in the River Thames, off Thornycroft's torpedo works, Chiswick, by a waterman named Henry Winslade.[58][59] Stones in Druitt's pockets had kept his body submerged for about a month.[60] He was carrying a train ticket to Hammersmith dated 1 December, a silver watch, a cheque for £50 and £16 in gold (equivalent to £4,100 and £1,300 today).[17][61][62] It is not known why he should have carried such a large amount of money,[63] but it could have been a final payment from the school.[27][64]
Some modern authors suggest that Druitt was dismissed because he was a homosexual or pederast and that it may have driven him to suicide.[65] One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer.[66] Others, however, think that there is no evidence of homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness.[67] His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888.[68] She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890.[69] His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane; his aunt attempted suicide; and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age.[70] A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, "Since Friday I felt that I was going to be like mother, and the best thing for me was to die."[71]
As was usual in the district, the inquest was held at the Lamb Tap public house, Chiswick, by the coroner Dr Thomas Bramah Diplock on 2 January 1889.[72] The coroner's jury concluded that Druitt had committed suicide by drowning while in an unsound state of mind.[73] He was buried in Wimborne cemetery the next day.[61][74] At probate, his estate was valued at £2,600 (equivalent to £214,800 today).[17][75]
It is not known why Druitt committed suicide in Chiswick. One suggested link is that one of his University friends, Thomas Seymour Tuke of the Tuke family, lived there. Tuke was a psychiatric doctor with whom Druitt played cricket, and Druitt's mother was committed to Tuke's asylum in 1890.[27][76] Another suggestion is that Druitt knew Harry Wilson, whose house, "The Osiers", lay between Hammersmith station and Thornycroft's wharf, where Druitt's body was found.[77]
